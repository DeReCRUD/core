# @de-re-crud/core

UI library used by all other De Re CRUD interface libraries. It contains utilities and components for creating De Re CRUD interfaces.

## Usage

The library can be installed with npm using:

`yarn add @de-re-crud/ui`

or using npm:

`npm install --save @de-re-crud/ui`

This library depends on `@de-re-crud/core` and `preact` and therefore they must be installed as well. If used directly in the browser, the API is accessible under `DeReCrud.ui`.
